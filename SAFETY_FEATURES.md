# üîí Firestore Safety Features

## Overview
This application now includes comprehensive safety measures to prevent runaway Firestore reads and protect your budget.

## üö® Safety Measures

### 1. Daily Read Limits
- **Maximum**: 1,000 reads per day (configurable)
- **Automatic Reset**: Daily at midnight
- **Emergency Stop**: No more reads when limit reached

### 2. Rate Limiting
- **Minimum Interval**: 1 second between reads
- **Prevents**: Rapid-fire requests that could spike costs

### 3. Cache Management
- **Maximum Entries**: 100 cached websites
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Removes oldest 20% when limit reached
- **Duration**: 10 minutes per cache entry

### 4. Real-Time Monitoring
- **Dashboard Display**: Shows current usage and warnings
- **Color Coding**: 
  - üü¢ Green: Safe (0-60% of limit)
  - üü° Yellow: Caution (60-80% of limit)
  - üî¥ Red: Warning (80-100% of limit)

## üìä Cost Protection

### Current Limits
- **Daily Cost**: $0.0006 (at 1,000 reads)
- **Monthly Cost**: $0.018 (at 1,000 reads/day)
- **Yearly Cost**: $0.22 (at 1,000 reads/day)

### What Happens When Limits Are Reached
1. **Safety Check Fails**: No more Firebase reads
2. **Fallback to Cache**: Serve cached data if available
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Website continues working with old data
4. **Console Warnings**: Clear error messages for debugging

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Easy to Adjust
Edit `src/config/safety.ts` to change limits:

```typescript
export const SAFETY_CONFIG = {
  MAX_DAILY_READS: 1000,        // Increase for higher traffic
  MAX_CACHE_SIZE: 100,          // Increase for more cached sites
  MIN_READ_INTERVAL: 1000,      // Decrease for faster updates
  CACHE_DURATION: 600000,       // Increase for longer caching
  WARNING_THRESHOLD: 0.8,       // 80% warning threshold
  CAUTION_THRESHOLD: 0.6        // 60% caution threshold
};
```

### Recommended Settings by Traffic

#### Low Traffic (1-10 visitors/day)
```typescript
MAX_DAILY_READS: 500
CACHE_DURATION: 30 * 60 * 1000  // 30 minutes
```

#### Medium Traffic (10-100 visitors/day)
```typescript
MAX_DAILY_READS: 1000
CACHE_DURATION: 10 * 60 * 1000  // 10 minutes
```

#### High Traffic (100+ visitors/day)
```typescript
MAX_DAILY_READS: 2000
CACHE_DURATION: 5 * 60 * 1000   // 5 minutes
```

## üöÄ How It Works

### For Website Visitors
1. **First Visit**: 2-3 Firebase reads, then cached
2. **Subsequent Visits**: 0 reads, served from cache
3. **Cache Expired**: 2-3 reads to refresh, then cached again

### For Company Owners
1. **Making Changes**: 1-2 reads + writes
2. **Real-Time Updates**: 0 additional reads
3. **Instant Updates**: Changes appear immediately

### Safety Checks
1. **Before Each Read**: Check daily limit, rate limit, cache size
2. **If Limits Reached**: Return cached data or null
3. **Logging**: Console warnings and error messages
4. **Monitoring**: Dashboard shows current status

## üì± Dashboard Features

### Safety Status Display
- **Current Usage**: Reads today / Daily limit
- **Cache Status**: Current entries / Maximum
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded warnings
- **Real-Time Updates**: Refreshes automatically

### Warning System
- **60% Threshold**: Yellow caution indicator
- **80% Threshold**: Red warning with alert icon
- **100% Threshold**: Emergency stop, no more reads

## üõ°Ô∏è Emergency Procedures

### If Limits Are Reached
1. **Immediate**: No more Firebase reads
2. **Short Term**: Serve cached data
3. **Long Term**: Increase limits in config
4. **Monitoring**: Watch dashboard for trends

### Recovery Steps
1. **Increase Limits**: Edit `safety.ts`
2. **Optimize Cache**: Adjust duration and size
3. **Monitor Usage**: Check dashboard regularly
4. **Scale Gradually**: Start with small increases

## üí° Best Practices

### For Development
- **Test Locally**: Monitor console for warnings
- **Start Conservative**: Use lower limits initially
- **Monitor Closely**: Watch dashboard during testing

### For Production
- **Set Realistic Limits**: Based on expected traffic
- **Monitor Regularly**: Check dashboard daily
- **Scale Gradually**: Increase limits as needed
- **Keep Backups**: All data stored in Firestore

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Safety check failed" errors
- **Cause**: Daily limit reached or rate limiting
- **Solution**: Wait for reset or increase limits

#### Cache not updating
- **Cause**: Safety limits preventing reads
- **Solution**: Check dashboard status, clear cache

#### Slow website updates
- **Cause**: Rate limiting (1 second minimum)
- **Solution**: Increase `MIN_READ_INTERVAL` if needed

### Debug Commands
```typescript
// Check current status
const stats = DataService.getReadStats();
console.log(stats);

// Clear all caches
DataService.clearCacheBySlug('your-slug');
```

## üìà Performance Impact

### With Safety Features
- **Reads**: Limited to configured daily maximum
- **Costs**: Predictable and controlled
- **Performance**: Fast with smart caching
- **Reliability**: Graceful degradation under load

### Without Safety Features
- **Reads**: Unlimited, could spike unexpectedly
- **Costs**: Unpredictable, could be very high
- **Performance**: Could slow down under load
- **Reliability**: Risk of service interruption

## üéØ Summary

These safety features ensure your Firestore costs remain predictable and controlled while maintaining excellent performance. The system automatically prevents runaway reads and provides clear monitoring tools to help you optimize your usage.
